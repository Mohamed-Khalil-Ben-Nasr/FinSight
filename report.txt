Predictions vs. Actuals
Year    Actual     Predicted    Error
2020     +26.76%       +2.37%    +24.40%
2021     +22.89%      +25.37%     +2.48%
2022     -30.82%      +12.37%    +43.19%

MAE: 23.36% (hardest year: 2022 — Structural shift not captured)

Finance Bro
Our calls were off by about 23.36% on average. The trickiest year was 2022 because Rate hikes and inflation jitters twisted the plot harder than expected.. Peep the chart at artifacts/predictions_vs_actual.svg to see predictions vs. reality.

Refinement Suggestions
- Blend macro indicators (CPI, unemployment) with the return features to capture regime shifts.
- Layer a sentiment score from earnings calls or news headlines to react faster to shocks.
- Use rolling walk-forward validation so the Prediction Agent continually re-trains with the latest year.

Mr. White's Briefing
Hey there, apprentice — Mr. White here.
We built FinSight as a relay race of specialists so you can trace every decision:
1. A LangChain Runnable sequence kicks off the show so every agent hands a structured state to the next.
2. DataCollector scrapes Yahoo Finance's ^GSPC history page (cached locally as data/dataset.json) and
   distills it into AnnualMetric objects covering 2015–2022. When the scrape is blocked we fall back
   to the bundled snapshot, so quality stays aligned with the same Yahoo feed.
3. Research Agent pins three macro story beats to each pre-pandemic year (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) and pushes
   them through a Pinecone vector store (pinecone_local_memory:import_error:Exception) so later agents can query a real RAG memory.
4. Prediction Agent studies those 2015–2019 patterns and drafts 2020–2022 calls with narratives.
5. Evaluator cross-checks predictions against actual returns, reports MAE and toughest year,
   which this run pegs at 23.36% average error with 2022 hardest because Structural shift not captured.
6. Finance Bro translates that into street language and points everyone to the SVG comparison chart.
7. Refinement Agent turns the misses into a backlog of upgrades so the next version learns.
8. Test Titan enforces contracts (no missing years, numeric MAE) before anyone declares victory.
9. Lord of the Mysteries packages everything and I, Mr. White, narrate the architecture so your
   curious mind sees how multi-agent orchestration feels in practice.

Finance Bro's verdict: Our calls were off by about 23.36% on average. The trickiest year was 2022 because Rate hikes and inflation jitters twisted the plot harder than expected.. Peep the chart at artifacts/predictions_vs_actual.svg to see predictions vs. reality.
Next experiments on deck: Blend macro indicators (CPI, unemployment) with the return features to capture regime shifts.; Layer a sentiment score from earnings calls or news headlines to react faster to shocks.; Use rolling walk-forward validation so the Prediction Agent continually re-trains with the latest year.
